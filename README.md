# Why I'm Doing One Month Rails

I feel like ideas are a dime a dozen...well I know ideas are a dime a dozen. It's the people that have a desire to make those ideas happen that take upton themselves to get them done, THEMSELVES! When you depend on others, and you taste dissapoint, you loose a lot of steam. It's this steam that you need to keep tightly sealed in you for it will push you through the moments when nothing is going as planned.

This is me sealing the steam. The first step is to add rails to my skills list :).
