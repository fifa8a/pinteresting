# Why I'm Doing One Month Rails

I feel like ideas are a dime a dozen...well I know ideas are a dime a dozen. It's the people that have a desire to make those ideas happen that take it upton themselves to get them done, BY THEMSELVES! When you depend on others, and you taste dissapointment, the steam that once kept you going slowly seeps out of you. It's this steam that you need to keep tightly sealed in you, for it will push you through the moments when nothing is going as planned.

This is me sealing in the steam. The first step is to add rails to my skills list :).
